Advanced Object Tracking System

Overview

The tracking.py module is an advanced Python-based object tracking framework that leverages computer vision algorithms and database management to track, analyze, and store object movement data in real time. Utilizing OpenCV, it detects and tracks objects within video streams, computing their respective velocities, trajectories, and positional centroids, which are subsequently logged into a persistent SQLite database for further analysis.

Features

Multi-Object Detection & Tracking: Employs feature-based and contour-based tracking techniques to monitor multiple objects concurrently.

Database-Integrated Logging: Stores dynamically computed object attributes, including ID, label, positional data, and velocity vectors, in an optimized SQLite relational database.

Kinematic Analysis: Implements motion estimation models to compute instantaneous and average speeds.

Temporal Data Acquisition: Captures precise timestamped movement metrics for historical trend analysis.

Efficient Data Retrieval: Supports structured queries on stored data, facilitating post-processing analytics.

Installation

Ensure that your system has Python installed, then execute the following command to install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

To initiate the object tracking system, execute:

python tracking.py

The system will process video input, detect objects, compute movement parameters, and log relevant data into the SQLite database.

Dependencies

opencv-python: Facilitates real-time video processing and feature-based object detection.

numpy: Used for numerical computations, including coordinate transformation and velocity estimation.

sqlite3: Provides a lightweight, disk-based storage solution for logging object tracking metadata.

Database Architecture

The tracking system employs a structured SQLite database (object_tracking.db) to maintain an extensive log of movement-related metadata. The schema follows:

CREATE TABLE tracking_data (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    object_id INTEGER,
    object_name TEXT,
    timestamp TEXT,
    centroid_x REAL,
    centroid_y REAL,
    speed REAL
);

Data Attributes:

id: Unique auto-incremented identifier for each tracking entry.

object_id: System-assigned identifier for tracked objects.

object_name: Custom label assigned to each detected object.

timestamp: ISO-formatted timestamp marking the data entry.

centroid_x & centroid_y: Computed spatial coordinates representing object positioning.

speed: Calculated movement speed based on inter-frame displacement.

Future Enhancements

Integration of Kalman Filters for predictive motion tracking.

Deep Learning-based Object Identification for enhanced accuracy.

Cloud-based Data Synchronization for remote access and analysis.
